    "personaDescriptionBullets": "Who they are: health-curious, home-proud, scent-as-wellbeing mindset\nAnchored functional job: keep home air clean, inviting, and odor-free day to day\nContext snapshot: Busy urban life, apartment living + humidity/food odors; primary aircare decision-maker; chooses scents that feel effective but not overpowering",
    "personaCoreJtbd": "They're trying to keep their home consistently fresh and welcoming, especially after cooking, humidity, or busy days, using simple aircare routines that work fast.

    "personaTriggersRoutines": "Triggers: Kicks in before guests or right after cooking, cleaning, or rainy/humid days—especially when the home air starts to feel 'heavy' or stale.\nRoutines: Quick daily freshness touchpoints (morning or post-clean), plus stronger weekend or post-odor resets; intensity adjusts by mood and moment.",
    "personaHiddenEmergingJobs": "Hidden beneath \"freshness,\" they're really using scent as a lightweight wellness tool to regulate mood and make home feel like a safe reset zone. Emerging jobs point to wanting air care that feels more natural/healthy and purpose-tied to moments (post-cooking reset, rainy-day lift, bedtime calm), not just odor masking.",
